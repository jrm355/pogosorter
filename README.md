# Pokemon Sorter
## Gives you the ability to filter out pokemon based either on what would be supereffective against the raid boss or by the pokemons typing. You can click either filter and easy select typings. 
## Technologies used include the pokeAPI

#### I had to pivot from my initial idea involving pokemon go, there are no good APIs that support pokemon go information. My initial approach was specifically to pogo, I wound up keeping the formatting and just allowed for filtering.
