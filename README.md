# Pokemon Sorter
## Gives you the ability to filter out pokemon based either on what would be supereffective against the raid boss or by the pokemons typing. You can click either filter and easy select typings. 
## Technologies used include the pokeAPI, axios to get the API, this is a REACT app, Right now I am only fetching the 151 original pokemon due to rate limits from the poke API, and to reduce the payload. 
### I used past notes, lots of online rescources. I came across plenty of problems, but I eventually found ways to resolve them.
#### I had to pivot from my initial idea involving pokemon go, there are no good APIs that support pokemon go information. My initial approach was specifically to pogo, I wound up keeping the formatting and just allowed for filtering.
